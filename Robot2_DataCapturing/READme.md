# Data Capturing Robot

This robot automates data entry into both a CRM web application and a desktop application simultaneously. The robot opens both applications, populates data in real-time, and saves it to the system.

Key learning points:
- UI automation for web and desktop applications.
- Using loops (for and while).
- Debugging processes.
- Effectively working with UI elements, descriptors, and selectors.
- Running two workflows simultaneously.
