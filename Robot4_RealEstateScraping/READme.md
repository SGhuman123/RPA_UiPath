# Real Estate Webscrapper

This bot automates the extraction and organization of property listings. The bot creates an Excel sheet (e.g., "New York") containing detailed property data, including price, beds, baths, square footage, price per square foot, address, city, zip code, and listing URL, all sorted from lowest to highest price.

**Key learning objectives for this project:**

- **UI Automation:** Using strict and fuzzy selectors, optimizing for speed and reliability.
- **Excel Automation:** Writing and organizing data, creating/deleting columns, sorting, filtering, formatting cells, and more.
