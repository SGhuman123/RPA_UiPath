# Clothing Consultant

In this project, I created a robot that would do the following:

- Ask users for a city
- Scapes the temperature data and weather condition data (eg: clear, cloudy,...) off Google based on the city inputted 
- Utilizes flowcharts to thereafter tell users whether to bring a raincoat or not.


**Key features of the project:**
- Using input dialogues to prompt user input.
- Creating flowcharts and making decisions with conditions.
- Attaching and scraping text from a Google browser.
- Using the Analyze Project feature to check for errors and workflow violations.
