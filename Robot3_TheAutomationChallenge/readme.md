# Automating data entry

This involves automating data entry on a dynamic web application, theautomationchallenge.com, which features changing layouts and field positions after every submission.

**Key tasks:**

- Download an Excel file with 50 rows of company data.
- Loop through the data and enter it into the web application fields.
- Handle dynamic changes in field location, size, selector, and label position, as well as the Submit button's position.

The robot prioritizes accuracy over speed and must use techniques like fuzzy selectors to adapt to the dynamic environment. Key concepts covered:

- Fuzzy selectors and their importance in handling changing selectors.
- Strict selectors and image fallbacks
- UI automation, including targets, anchors, attributes, and robust selector definitions
